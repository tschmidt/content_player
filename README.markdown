# jQuery Plugin: Content Player

There are a badjillion (ok, perhaps less than that) plugins that do something similar to this but I didn't really care for any of them. Mainly because they were either way too complex or way too opinionated on how I should structure my HTML. For these reasons, I set out to create my own solution and this is what I came up with.

Download the project and view the index.html for examples of how to use it. Feedback is always welcome.
